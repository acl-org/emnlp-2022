The EMNLP 2022 logo features an eight-pointed star constructed from rotated repetitions of the ACL's iconic logo.

The eight-pointed star is a classic Islamic Arabesque design motif. It is not unique to Abu Dhabi, but quite beloved here. 

We see it from the design of the central prayer hall in the Grand Mosque to the dome of the Louvre Museum.

The logo was designed by [Nizar Habash](https://www.nizarhabash.com/).
